<p class="title">TO AMEND THE SOUTH CAROLINA CODE OF LAWS BY ENACTING THE "ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE PROTECTION ACT"; AND BY ADDING CHAPTER 23 TO TITLE 63 SO AS TO PROHIBIT THE STATE GOVERNMENT FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PERSONS WHO PROVIDE ADOPTION OR FOSTER-CARE SERVICES BASED UPON A SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEF, TO DEFINE TERMS, TO CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST THE STATE GOVERNMENT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE CHAPTER, TO ALLOW CERTAIN REMEDIES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_enacting_words">Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina:</p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="sc_section">SECTION 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;This act may be cited as the "Adoption and Foster Care Protection Act".</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_section">SECTION 2.&nbsp; &nbsp; The General Assembly hereby finds:</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_section">(1) This State seeks to place children in a safe, loving, and supportive home when the State must place a child with an adoptive or foster family.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(2) As of January 2023, forty-five child placing agencies in this State assist families with adoptive and foster care placements.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(3) The adoption and foster care agencies of this State represent diverse organizations and groups, some of which are faith-based and some of which are not faith-based.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(4) Children in need of placement services benefit from having as many adoption and foster parent agencies as possible because the more agencies that take part in these services, the greater the likelihood that the child will find a permanent placement.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(5) The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the benefits of having more, not fewer, adoption and foster care providers, finding that the availability of faith-based programs would likely increase, not reduce, the number of available foster parents. Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868 (2021).</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(6) Children and families benefit greatly from the adoption and foster care services provided by faith-based and nonfaith-based child placing agencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(7) Faith-based organizations and groups have a lengthy and distinguished history of providing adoption and foster care services in this State.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(8) Private child placing agencies and individuals, including faith-based child placing agencies and individuals, have the right to free exercise of religion under both the state and federal constitutions. Under well-settled principles of constitutional law, this right includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that conflicts with an agency's sincerely held religious beliefs.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(9) The State needs to ensure that faith-based child placing agencies can continue to provide adoption and foster care services that will benefit the children and families who receive those services.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(10) The U.S. Constitution allows all adoption and foster care providers to operate according to their beliefs without fear of unjust governmental punishment.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(11) In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that state governments violate the requirements of religious neutrality when they undermine religious beliefs or practices, stating that "[g]overnment fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature."  Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868 (2021). </p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(12) "The Constitution forbids laws that prohibit the free exercise of religion. That guarantee protects not just the right to be a religious person, holding beliefs inwardly and secretly; it also protects the right to act on those beliefs outwardly and publicly." Espinoza v. Montana Dep't of Revenue, 140 S. Ct. 2246, 2276 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(13) The U.S. Supreme Court has "long recognized the importance of protecting religious actions, not just religious status." Espinoza v. Montana Dep't of Revenue, 140 S. Ct. 2246, 2276 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). "[T]he First Amendment protects the 'freedom to act' as well as the 'freedom to believe." Id. (quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 3030 (1940)).</p>
<p></p>
<p class="sc_empty_line">(14) The government violates the Free Exercise Clause whenever it "conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, orâ€¦ denies such benefit because of conduct mandated by a religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior to violate his beliefs." Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-18 (1981).</p>
<p></p>
