Creates a right of action for violation of a parent's rights with respect to the upbringing, education, and health care of the parent's child. Provides that a child is not a child in need of services due to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian: (1) referring to and raising the child consistent with the child's biological sex; or (2) declining to consent to the child receiving: (A) specified medication; (B) a medical procedure the purpose of which is to alter the apparent gender or sex of the child or affirm the child's perception of the child's gender or sex in a manner inconsistent with the child's biological sex; or (C) counseling or other mental health services the purpose of which is to affirm the child's perception of the child's gender or sex if the child's perception is inconsistent with the child's biological sex. Provides that if the juvenile court finds that a child is a child in need of services because the child substantially endangers the child's own or another's health, the court shall release the child to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian and may not enter a dispositional decree ordering removal of the child, unless: (1) the court also finds that the child is a child in need of services for another reason; or (2) the parent, guardian, or custodian consents to the child being removed from the child's home. Specifies that the parental rights and responsibilities do not: (1) authorize a parent to: (A) abuse or neglect a child; or (B) make the decision to end the child's life; or (2) prohibit a court from issuing an order that is otherwise permitted by law.

    "description": "Youth Health Protection Act established; civil penalty. Creates Youth Health Protection Act established; civil penalty. Creates the Youth Health Protection Act (the Act), which makes it unlawful for any individual to provide gender transition procedures for minors and prohibits the use of public funds for gender transition procedures. The bill allows parents, guardians, or custodians to withhold consent for any treatment, activity, or mental health care services that are designed and intended to form their child's conceptions of sex and gender or to treat gender dysphoria or gender nonconformity. The bill prohibits government agents, other than law-enforcement personnel, from encouraging or coercing a minor to withhold information from the minor's parent. The bill establishes a duty for a government agent with knowledge that a minor has exhibited symptoms of gender dysphoria or gender nonconformity or otherwise demonstrates a desire to be treated in a manner incongruent with the minor's sex to immediately notify each of the minor's parents, guardians, or custodians in writing, with descriptions of relevant circumstances. The bill prohibits discrimination against persons (i) providing information regarding violations of the Act to their employer or specified public entities or (ii) who make disclosures under the Act believed to be a violation of law, rule, or regulation; any violation of any standard of care or other ethical guidelines for the provision of health care service; or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The bill establishes a civil action for any violation of the Act by a clinic, health care system, medical professional, or other responsible person with a two-year statute of limitations. The bill prohibits political subdivisions of the Commonwealth from enacting, adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure that interferes with the professional conduct and judgment of a mental health care professional or counselor undertaken within the course of treatment and communication with clients, patients, other persons, or the public. The bill provides for enforcement by the Attorney General or a mental health care professional or counsel through an action for injunctive relief and allows a mental health care professional to recover reasonable attorney fees and reasonable costs incurred in obtaining an injunction. The bill waives sovereign immunity to suit and immunity from liability under this statute.",

Requires each public elementary or secondary school and each public institution of higher education to expressly designate all interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams and sports sponsored by such school based on biological sex as follows: (i) for \"males,\" \"men,\" or \"boys\"; (ii) for \"females,\" \"women,\" or \"girls\"; or (iii) as \"coed\" or \"mixed\" if such team or sport is open to participation by both (a) males, men, or boys and (b) females, women, or girls. The bill provides that a student's \"biological sex\" is the statement of such student's biological sex on such student's official birth certificate if the statement was filed at or near the time of the student's birth. The bill prohibits any student whose biological sex is female from participating on any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club team or sport that is expressly designated for \"males,\" \"men,\" or \"boys,\" unless such school or institution does not offer an equivalent team or sport that is expressly designated for \"females,\" \"women,\" or \"girls,\" or as \"coed\" or \"mixed.\" The bill also prohibits any student whose biological sex is male from participation on any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club team or sport that is expressly designated for \"females,\" \"women,\" or \"girls.\" Furthermore, the bill prohibits any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a public elementary or secondary school or sponsored by a public institution of higher education from competing against any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a private elementary or secondary school or a private institution of higher education unless such private school or institution also complies with the provisions of the bill. Finally, the bill creates a civil cause of action for students that suffer any deprivation, harm, retaliation, or adverse action or for schools that suffer any harm as a result of a violation of the provisions of the bill, provided that such action is initiated within two years of such deprivation, harm, retaliation, or adverse action.",

The bill requires the Board of Education to include in its guidelines for making such contact criteria to assess whether students have begun to self-identify as a gender different from their biological sex and criteria for notification of and discussions with parents of students self-identifying as a gender different from their biological sex. The bill also prohibits any licensed school counselor, professional counselor, clinical social worker, or psychologist or other counseling personnel in any school division from (i) encouraging or coercing a minor to withhold from the minor's parent the fact that the minor's perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor's biological sex or (ii) withholding from a minor's parent information relating to the minor's perception that his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor's biological sex. Finally, the bill clarifies, in the definition of the term \"abused or neglected child,\" that in no event shall referring to and raising the child in a manner consistent with the child's biological sex, including related mental health or medical decisions, be considered abuse or neglect.",
