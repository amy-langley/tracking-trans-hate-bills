<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) Any individual listed in subsection (E)(6), here forth referred to as the complainant, may report alleged violations to the head of the respective SFEE, or his designee. Multiple violations may be submitted in a single report and shall each count as individual violations. To be deemed valid, reports of alleged violations must be submitted in writing and accompanied by documentary, tangible, or testimonial evidence and may not rely on hearsay. The SFEE shall promptly investigate each alleged violation and issue a formal written response to the complainant within fifteen days of receiving his report. Confidentiality of all parties shall be maintained throughout the investigation. The SFEE shall not engage in any adverse treatment of the complainant. If the alleged violation is found valid, the SFEE shall take immediate corrective action, which shall include:</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(i) removing all materials found in violation, discontinuing any such instruction, programs, initiatives, or activities;</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) upon first offense, issuing a written warning to the individual responsible for the violation. Upon a subsequent offense, taking disciplinary action consistent with other employment policy infractions, which shall include as a minimum suspension of duties and up to and including termination depending on the severity of the violation. Violation of this section by an educator shall be considered a violation of the South Carolina Educator's Standards of Conduct that justifies disciplinary sanction by the State Board of Education in accordance with applicable regulations promulgated by the State Board. For the purposes of this section, "educator" means a professional employee of any place of learning whose position requires certification by the State Board and includes administrators and specialists. Violations involving dissemination of materials harmful to minors in subsection (C)(5)(a), shall be enforced in accordance with applicable sections of Article 3, Chapter 15, Title 16;</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) notifying all parents and employees of the SFEE of the violation and corrective action taken. Confidentiality of all parties shall be maintained; and</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(iv) notifying the State Board of the violation and corrective action taken. Confidentiality of the complainant shall be maintained. The State Board shall maintain a record of all such violations and provide an annual written report to the General Assembly indicating the quantity and nature of all violations reported and the SFEEs involved.</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) If the complainant or defending party do not agree with the SFEE's determination or if corrective action is not immediately taken, they may appeal to the SFEE's overseeing authority, if one exists, within sixty days of receiving the determination. The overseeing authority shall review the report, maintaining confidentiality of all parties, and issue a formal written response within fifteen days. If the report is found valid, the overseeing authority shall compel the SFEE to take immediate corrective action in accordance with subsection (E)(1)(a).</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) If the complainant does not agree with the SFEE's overseeing authority's determination, or if the SFEE does not take immediate corrective action when so directed by the overseeing authority, he may appeal to the State Attorney General within sixty days of receiving the determination. The Attorney General shall, within thirty days of receiving the appeal, investigate the violation report while maintaining confidentiality of all parties. If the Attorney General finds the SFEE violated a provision of this section, he shall issue a written and detailed Notice of Noncompliance to the SFEE and its overseeing authority stating the nature of the violation and results of the investigation. The SFEE shall have fifteen days from receiving the notice to demonstrate compliance through taking corrective action satisfactory to the Attorney General and in accordance with subsection (E)(1)(a), or to dispute the violation in writing. Failure to respond shall be deemed admission of noncompliance. Upon reviewing the entity's response, the Attorney General may dismiss the violation or determine that the noncompliance stands, in which case his office shall file a court action seeking full enforcement under this section. An SFEE found by the court to have violated a provision of this section must, for each violation, lose twenty percent of its state funding including grant amounts, until it demonstrates compliance to the Attorney General. Funding withheld pursuant to this subsection shall be retroactive to the date of Notice of Noncompliance, must be forfeited, and may not be repaid unless the SFEE successfully demonstrates full compliance with this section without further violations for a period of twelve consecutive months after the court's ruling. The loss of funding and grant money pursuant to this subsection must be prorated and returned by the SFEE to the Office of the State Treasurer within forty-five days of the court's ruling. </p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) Violation of this section by an educator shall be considered a violation of the South Carolina Educator's Standards of Conduct that justifies disciplinary sanction by the State Board of Education in accordance with its regulations. For the purposes of this section, educator means a professional employee of any place of learning whose position requires certification by the State Board and includes administrators and specialists.</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(e) Students enrolled in a public place of learning up to and including grade twelve that has been determined by a court to be in violation of subsections (C) or (D) and that, as a result, has lost any portion of its state funding or grant money, shall have the right to transfer to another public place of learning within reasonable distance. The students' school transportation, or transportation costs, shall be provided or paid for by the SFEE found to be in violation.</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Funding, loans, grants, assistance of any type, curricula, instructional materials, professional development courses, training, presentations, programs, activities, books, media or resources of any type in any format accepted from federal or other third-party sources, whether public or private, by an SFEE shall be in full compliance with this section. Any violations shall be subject to enforcement in accordance with subsection (E)(1), and additionally, if determined to be in noncompliance, all third-party funding, grants, and resources shall be returned. The South Carolina Department of Education, the State Board, public school districts, and all state government agencies overseeing places of learning are prohibited from accepting any third-party funding or resources that violate subsections (C) or (D).</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Within thirty days after the effective date of this section, an SFEE shall:</p>

<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) send an email or letter notification to all its employees, students, and parents of students with the complete text of this law, and subsequently, places of learning shall send such a notification within thirty days of the start of every academic year.</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) To ensure transparency of instruction, every place of learning up to and including grade twelve shall:</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) within ninety days after the effective date of this section, make readily available to the public on its website and as a printed document upon request, the full list of classes, curricula with lesson units, reading materials, including title, author, and publisher, resources, including online, video or audio materials, field trips, presentations, and materials regardless of media format that are used for student instruction, including primary and reference materials, made available in a library, media center, or online, or provided as staff training, workshop, or professional development. This information must be accessible to the public without requiring registration or use of a user name, password, or other user identification. This information must remain available for each current academic year and the immediately preceding academic year;</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) upon request, allow full access to parents or legal custodians of students enrolled in the place of learning to review in person any instructional materials, books, media, content in libraries, media centers, or classroom collections, or materials used in staff professional trainings.

<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) the impartial teaching or discussion of public policy issues of the day; ideas that individuals may find unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive; controversial aspects of history; or the historical existence of discriminatory concepts or scientifically unproven theories as part of a larger course of academic instruction, in an age-appropriate, objective, and viewpoint-neutral manner without endorsement.</p>
<p class="sc_new_code_section">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(6) During the process described in section (E)(1), the complainant, including any parent or legal custodian of a student, any emancipated minor student or adult student age eighteen or older, and any employee or volunteer of an SFEE shall have the right to refuse, or have his or her child refuse, to participate in any lessons, presentations, trainings, programs, assignments, activities, or be given access to any books, media, or content in any format that he or she believes violate one or more of the concepts or activities described in subsections (C) or (D).
