<p class=P06-00>Sec.&nbsp;2. Section 12-741, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:</p>

<p class=SEC06-17><span
style='display:none'>START_STATUTE</span><span class=SNUM>12-741.</span> <span
class=SECHEAD>Unauthorized disclosure of intimate images; civil action;
exceptions; confidential information form; remedies; statute of limitations;
definitions</span></p>

<p class=P06-00>A. A person is liable in a civil action for
intentionally disclosing or threatening to disclose an intimate image of
another individual if the depicted individual suffers harm from the disclosure
or threatened disclosure and the person knew or should have known all of the
following:</p>

<p class=P06-00>1. The depicted individual did not consent to the
disclosure.</p>

<p class=P06-00>2. The intimate image was private.</p>

<p class=P06-00>3. The depicted individual was identifiable from the
image itself or from information that is displayed in connection with the
image.</p>

<p class=P06-00>B. Evidence that the depicted individual consented
to the creation of the image or that the depicted individual previously
consented to the disclosure of the image does not by itself establish that the
depicted individual consented to the disclosure of the intimate image or that the
depicted individual lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>

<p class=P06-00>C. A depicted individual who does not consent to the
specific sexual activities or state of nudity depicted in an intimate image of
the individual retains a reasonable expectation of privacy even if the image
was created when the depicted individual was in a public place.</p>

<p class=P06-00>D. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a
person is not liable under this section if the person proves that disclosing or
threatening to disclose the intimate image was any of the following:</p>

<p class=P06-00 style='page-break-after:avoid'>1. Made in good faith
in any of the following:</p>

<p class=P06-00 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(a) Law enforcement.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) A legal proceeding.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(c) Medical education or treatment.</p>

<p class=P06-00>2. Made in good faith in reporting or investigating
any of the following:</p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) Unlawful conduct.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) Unsolicited and unwelcome conduct.</p>

<p class=P06-00>3. Related to a matter of public concern or public
interest.</p>

<p class=P06-00>4. Reasonably intended to assist the depicted
individual.</p>

<p class=P06-00>5. Made by a parent, legal guardian or individual
with legal custody of a child and the depicted individual is the child unless
the image is disclosed with the intent to harm the depicted individual.</p>

<p class=P06-00>E. Subsection D of this section does not apply if
the plaintiff proves the disclosure was prohibited by law or made for the
purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification, humiliation, degradation or
monetary or commercial gain.</p>

<p class=P06-00>F. Disclosing or threatening to disclose an intimate
image is not a matter of public concern or public interest solely because the
depicted individual is a public figure.</p>

<p class=P06-00>G. If the plaintiff files with the court and serves
on the defendant a confidential information form that includes the excluded or
redacted plaintiff's name and other identifying characteristics, the court may
exclude or redact from all pleadings and documents filed in the action other
identifying characteristics of the plaintiff. The court may make
further orders as necessary to protect the identity and privacy of a plaintiff.</p>

<p class=P06-00>H. The prevailing plaintiff may recover:</p>

<p class=P06-00>1. The greater of:</p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) Economic and noneconomic damages that are
proximately caused by the defendant's disclosure or threatened disclosure,
including damages for emotional distress whether or not accompanied by other
damages.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) Statutory damages of not more than $10,000
against each defendant found liable under this section for all of the
defendant's disclosures and threatened disclosures that the plaintiff knew or
reasonably should have known when filing the action or that became known during
the pendency of the action. In determining the amount of statutory
damages under this subdivision, consideration must be given to the age of the
parties at the time of the disclosure or threatened disclosure, the number of
disclosures or threatened disclosures made by the defendant, the breadth of
distribution of the image by the defendant and other exacerbating or mitigating
factors. </p>

<p class=P06-00>2. An amount equal to any monetary gain made by the
defendant from disclosing or threatening to disclose the intimate image.</p>

<p class=P06-00>3. Punitive damages.</p>

<p class=P06-00>4. Reasonable attorney fees and costs. </p>

<p class=P06-00>5. Additional relief, including injunctive relief.</p>

<p class=P06-00>I. A civil action for an unauthorized disclosure may
not be brought later than four years after the date that the disclosure was
discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable
diligence except that a threat to disclose may not be brought later than four
years after the date of the threat to disclose.</p>

<p class=P06-00>J. In a civil action brought by a depicted
individual who was a minor on the date of the disclosure or threat to disclose,
the time specified in subsection I of this section does not begin to run until
the depicted individual attains the age of majority.</p>

<p class=P06-00>K. For the purposes of this section:</p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) Created or obtained under circumstances in which
a depicted individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
