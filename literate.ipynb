    "1. We can construct a more familiar name for a proposed bill using `state` and `billId`, for example \"AR HB1156\". We will use this later.\n",
    "1. Each record has a `status` field whose interpretation is not self-documenting. This will probably merit more investigation.\n",
    "1. There is a date on each record. We can use these to build interactive / animated visualizations later.\n",
    "1. Each record has a field called `legiscanId`. [Legiscan](http://legiscan.com/about) is, apparently, \"the nation's first impartial real-time legislative tracking service designed for both public citizens and government affairs professionals\".\n",
    "1. Perhaps by investigating legiscan a little more we can unlock the meaning of those `legiscanId` fields.\n",
