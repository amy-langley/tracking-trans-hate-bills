    "description": "K-12 schools and institutions of higher education; K-12 schools and institutions of higher education; interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, and club athletic teams and sports; participation on teams based on biological sex; certain requirements; civil cause of action. Requires each public elementary or secondary school and each public institution of higher education to expressly designate all interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams and sports sponsored by such school based on biological sex as follows: (i) for \"males,\" \"men,\" or \"boys\"; (ii) for \"females,\" \"women,\" or \"girls\"; or (iii) as \"coed\" or \"mixed\" if such team or sport is open to participation by both (a) males, men, or boys and (b) females, women, or girls. The bill provides that a student's \"biological sex\" is the statement of such student's biological sex on such student's official birth certificate if the statement was filed at or near the time of the student's birth. The bill prohibits any student whose biological sex is female from participating on any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club team or sport that is expressly designated for \"males,\" \"men,\" or \"boys,\" unless such school or institution does not offer an equivalent team or sport that is expressly designated for \"females,\" \"women,\" or \"girls,\" or as \"coed\" or \"mixed.\" The bill also prohibits any student whose biological sex is male from participation on any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club team or sport that is expressly designated for \"females,\" \"women,\" or \"girls.\" Furthermore, the bill prohibits any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a public elementary or secondary school or sponsored by a public institution of higher education from competing against any interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a private elementary or secondary school or a private institution of higher education unless such private school or institution also complies with the provisions of the bill. Finally, the bill creates a civil cause of action for students that suffer any deprivation, harm, retaliation, or adverse action or for schools that suffer any harm as a result of a violation of the provisions of the bill, provided that such action is initiated within two years of such deprivation, harm, retaliation, or adverse action.",
