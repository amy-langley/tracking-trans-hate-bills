<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 37-13-171.&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The local school
board of every public school district shall adopt a policy to implement abstinence-only
or abstinence-plus education into its curriculum by June 30, 2012, which instruction
in those subjects shall be implemented not later than the start of the 2012-2013
school year or the local school board shall adopt the program which has been developed
by the Mississippi Department of Human Services and the Mississippi Department of
Health.&nbsp; The State Department of Education shall approve each district's curriculum
for sex-related education and shall establish a protocol to be used by districts
to provide continuity in teaching the approved curriculum in a manner that is age,
grade and developmentally appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Abstinence-only education
shall remain the state standard for any sex-related education taught in the public
schools.&nbsp; For purposes of this section, abstinence-only education includes any type
of instruction or program which, at an appropriate age and grade:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Teaches the social,
psychological and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Teaches the harmful
consequences to the child, the child's parents and society that bearing children

from sexual activity before marriage, and fidelity within marriage, is the only
certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and
related health problems.&nbsp; The instruction or program may include a discussion on
condoms or contraceptives, but only if that discussion includes a factual presentation
of the risks and failure rates of those contraceptives.&nbsp; In no case shall the instruction
or program include any demonstration of how condoms or other contraceptives are
applied;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; Teaches the current

education is discussed or taught, boys and girls shall be separated according to
